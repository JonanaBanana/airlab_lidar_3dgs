# LiGa Splat - LiDAR-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting Pipeline
A ROS2 pipeline for capturing LiDAR + camera data and converting it into the COLMAP format required to train a [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) model.
This pipeline has the advantage of not relying on visual features for pose extraction and sparse point cloud generation, and can thus work in environments not suitable for the regular COLMAP + 3DGS pipeline. Such environments could be sparse environments like wind turbine scans, or low texture homogenous environments like freighter hulls or tunnels.

With accurate input poses, point clouds, and camera intrinsics, the reconstruction results are very good, both photometrically and geometrically.

As an additional enhancement for sparse scenes with a lot of free space, it is possible to add a background sphere to initialize free space (floating) points on a background. This will further improve sparse environment reconstruction, by providing a clear separation between foreground and background.

This work is a successor to [MESSER for 3DGS](https://github.com/JonanaBanana/MESSER_for_3DGS). It converts the code to C++ and improves upon the pipeline by adding more robust behavior and faster computation with multi-thread processing.

This package has been tested with Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS2 Humble.

## Dependencies

- ROS2 (Humble or later)
- PCL, OpenCV, Eigen3, yaml-cpp
- OpenMP (for parallelised utilities)

```bash
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-pcl-conversions ros-$ROS_DISTRO-cv-bridge \
     libyaml-cpp-dev libopencv-dev libeigen3-dev
```
If you only need the utility code and dont want to install ROS2, you can skip installing ROS2 and ROS2 packages, and simply run the scripts in the utils/ folder as standalone scripts. They do not depend on ROS2.

---

## Build

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select liga_splat
source install/setup.bash
```
Again, skip this part if you do not want to use ROS2.
---

## Overview

The pipeline has two phases:

**Phase 1 — Data capture (ROS2 nodes)**
Subscribe to live sensor topics, accumulate and downsample the point cloud in real time, and save images, odometry, and the final point cloud to disk.

**Phase 2 — Offline processing (standalone utilities)**
Process the saved data into the COLMAP format that 3DGS training expects.

## Configuration

The pipeline uses two configuration files.

---

### `config/launch_config.cfg` — Phase 1 (ROS2 launch)

Edit this before running the ROS2 launch files. It controls topic names, output paths, and real-time point cloud management.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `output_dir` | — | Root folder where captured data (images, point cloud, timestamps) is saved |
| `bag_output_dir` | — | Folder for rosbag recordings (used by `record_bag_launch`) |
| `lidar_topic` | `/isaacsim/lidar` | ROS topic for incoming `PointCloud2` messages |
| `odom_topic` | `/isaacsim/odom` | ROS topic for incoming `Odometry` messages |
| `image_topic` | `/isaacsim/rgb` | ROS topic for incoming `Image` messages |
| `image_save_interval` | `10` | Save every Nth image frame to disk |
| `image_prefix` | `frame` | Filename prefix for saved images (e.g. `frame_0001.png`) |
| `odom_save_interval` | `1` | Save every Nth odometry message to `timestamps/odom.csv` |
| `leaf_size` | `0.03` | Voxel grid leaf size in metres used by both the accumulator and global processor |
| `max_path_length` | `10000` | Maximum number of odometry poses kept in the visualised path |
| `accumulator_max_points` | `500000` | The `PointCloudAccumulator` voxel-filters and forwards its buffer to the `GlobalProcessor` when the accumulated point count reaches this threshold |
| `accumulator_publish_interval` | `100` | Also forward the buffer every N LiDAR frames regardless of size (set to `0` to disable) |
| `global_downsample_interval` | `5` | The `GlobalProcessor` runs a periodic voxel downsample on the global map every N received batches |
| `global_max_points` | `5000000` | Hard cap on the global cloud; if exceeded after a periodic downsample a second pass at `2× leaf_size` is applied to bring it back under budget |
| `frame_id` | `World` | TF frame ID stamped on all published point cloud messages |

---

### `config.cfg` — Phase 2 (per-dataset, offline utilities)

This file lives inside each **data folder** (i.e. `<output_dir>/config.cfg`). It is read by every offline utility in Phase 2. Copy or create it manually for each dataset before running the utilities.

#### Pose estimation

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `time_delay` | `0.0` | Seconds added to each image timestamp before matching against odometry. Use a positive value to compensate for camera trigger latency (delays the image timestamp so it aligns with a later odometry sample); use a negative value to advance it. |

#### Camera intrinsics

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `focal_length` | `1000.0` | Camera focal length in pixels (assumes equal horizontal and vertical focal length, i.e. square pixels) |
| `image_width` | `1920` | Image width in pixels |
| `image_height` | `1080` | Image height in pixels |
| `principal_x` | `960.0` | Horizontal principal point (optical centre) in pixels |
| `principal_y` | `540.0` | Vertical principal point (optical centre) in pixels |

#### Point cloud filtering (registration step)

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `voxel_size` | `0.05` | Voxel grid leaf size in metres used to downsample `pcd/input.pcd` before colour registration |
| `min_depth` | `1.0` | Minimum camera-frame depth (metres) for a point to be projected onto an image |
| `max_depth` | `200.0` | Maximum camera-frame depth (metres); points beyond this are ignored |
| `filter_outliers` | `true` | Apply Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR) before voxel downsampling |
| `sor_neighbors` | `10` | Number of nearest neighbours used by the SOR filter |
| `sor_std_ratio` | `2.0` | Standard-deviation multiplier threshold for SOR; points further than `sor_std_ratio × σ` from the mean neighbour distance are removed |

#### Hidden point removal

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `hpr_radius` | `25000.0` | Radius parameter for the Hidden Point Removal (HPR) algorithm used during colour registration. Smaller values are more aggressive at removing occluded points. |
| `depth_render_hpr_radius` | `40000.0` | HPR radius used specifically by the `depth_renderer` utility. Can be tuned independently of `hpr_radius`. |

#### Background sphere

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `fill_background` | `false` | When `true`, a uniformly-sampled sphere of points is added around the scene centroid before registration. Useful for sparse scenes where the 3DGS optimiser would otherwise place large "background blobs" at arbitrary distances. |
| `sphere_radius` | `50.0` | Radius of the background sphere in metres |
| `sphere_num_points` | `50000` | Number of points uniformly sampled on the background sphere |

#### Camera–body transform

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `trans_mat` | (see below) | Row-major 4×4 homogeneous transform matrix **from camera frame to body frame** (T_body_cam). Provide 16 space- or comma-separated values. The default converts from a z-forward / x-right / y-down camera frame to an x-forward / y-left / z-up body frame. |
| `poses_are_body_frame` | `true` | Set to `true` if the saved odometry poses are expressed in the body/robot frame (most common). Set to `false` if poses are already in the camera frame, in which case `trans_mat` is ignored. |

Default `trans_mat` (row-major):
```
[0,  0,  1, 0,
-1,  0,  0, 0,
 0, -1,  0, 0,
 0,  0,  0, 1]
```

#### File paths (relative to `data_folder`)

These rarely need to change unless you have reorganised the folder layout.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `pcd_file` | `pcd/input.pcd` | Raw captured point cloud written by Phase 1 |
| `downsampled_file` | `pcd/downsampled.pcd` | Filtered + optionally sphere-padded cloud written by `registration` |
| `reconstructed_file` | `pcd/reconstructed.pcd` | Coloured point cloud written by `reconstruction` |
| `poses_file` | `poses.csv` | Interpolated camera poses written by `pose_estimator` |
| `registration_file` | `color_registration.csv` | Per-point colour observations written by `registration` |
| `pose_timestamps_file` | `timestamps/odom.csv` | Odometry timestamps written by Phase 1 |
| `image_timestamps_file` | `timestamps/image.csv` | Image timestamps written by Phase 1 |
| `images_dir` | `distorted/images` | Directory containing the saved camera frames |
| `depth_dir` | `depth_renders` | Directory where `depth_renderer` writes float32 TIFF depth maps |

---

## Phase 1 — Data Capture

### Option A — Record a rosbag first, play back later

```bash
ros2 launch liga_splat record_bag_launch.py
```

Records LiDAR, camera, odometry, and TF to a timestamped bag in `bag_output_dir`.  
Split size is 1 GB per bag file.

### Option B — Save data directly from live topics

```bash
ros2 launch liga_splat data_saver_launch.py
```

Starts five composable nodes in a single container:

| Node | Role |
|------|------|
| `PointCloudAccumulator` | Buffers incoming LiDAR scans; voxel-filters and forwards when the point count exceeds `accumulator_max_points` (or every `accumulator_publish_interval` frames) |
| `GlobalProcessor` | Maintains a persistent global cloud; periodically downsamples it and saves it as `pcd/input.pcd` |
| `PathPublisher` | Publishes the odometry path for RViz visualisation |
| `ImageSaver` | Saves images and writes `timestamps/image.csv` |
| `OdomSaver` | Saves odometry poses to `timestamps/odom.csv` |

RViz opens automatically with a pre-configured layout.

When capture is complete, kill the launch (Ctrl-C). The global cloud is saved automatically to `<output_dir>/pcd/input.pcd`.

**Output layout after capture:**
```
<output_dir>/
  pcd/input.pcd
  distorted/images/frame_0001.png ...
  timestamps/image.csv
  timestamps/odom.csv
```

---

## Phase 2 — Offline Processing

All utilities are run as:

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat <utility> <data_folder> [options]
```

where `<data_folder>` is the `output_dir` you set in `launch_config.cfg`.

Each utility reads its parameters from `<data_folder>/config.cfg`.

---
> [!WARNING]
> **`config.cfg` must be present in your data folder before running any Phase 2 utility.**
>
> Copy the template and edit it to match your camera and scene:
> ```bash
> cp path/to/liga_splat/config/config.cfg <data_folder>/config.cfg
> ```
> At minimum, set the camera intrinsics (`focal_length`, `image_width`, `image_height`, `principal_x`, `principal_y`) and the camera-to-body transform (`trans_mat`).
> Without this file the utilities will fall back to built-in defaults and produce **incorrect results**.
---

---

### 1. pose_estimator

Matches each saved image to an interpolated odometry pose (linear position + SLERP orientation). A `time_delay` parameter compensates for camera trigger latency.

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat pose_estimator <data_folder>
```

**Output:** `<data_folder>/poses.csv`

---

### 2. registration

Projects the point cloud into each camera image to assign an RGB colour to every visible point. Outputs both a downsampled point cloud (with an optional background sphere added) and a per-point colour observation table.

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat registration <data_folder> [--diag]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--diag` | Save false-colour depth overlay images to `diagnostics/color_registration/` |

**Output:**
- `pcd/downsampled.pcd` — geometry used for all downstream steps
- `color_registration.csv` — per-point colour observations

---

### 3. reconstruction

Fuses the multi-view colour observations into a single coloured point cloud. Each point's final colour is the per-channel median across all views, which suppresses shadows, highlights, and moving objects.

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat reconstruction <data_folder> [--ascii]
```

**Output:** `pcd/reconstructed.pcd`

---

### 4. export_colmap

Exports poses and point cloud in the COLMAP binary/text format required by 3DGS. Runs hidden-point removal per camera to build realistic 2D observation tracks.

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat export_colmap <data_folder>
```

**Output:** `distorted/sparse/0/{cameras,images,points3D}.{bin,txt}`

---

### 5. depth_renderer

Renders a float32 depth map (metres) for each camera pose using the downsampled point cloud. Supports optional hidden-point removal and colour-guided dense completion.

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat depth_renderer <data_folder> [--no-hpr] [--dense] [--diag]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--no-hpr` | Skip hidden-point removal (faster, less accurate) |
| `--dense` | Fill gaps using colour-guided joint bilateral filtering |
| `--diag` | Save false-colour visualisation PNGs to `diagnostics/depth_renders/` |

**Output:** `<depth_dir>/*.tiff`  (default: `depth_renders/`)

---

### 6. prepare_depth_for_3dgs

Converts the float32 TIFF depth maps into 16-bit PNG inverse-depth maps and writes `depth_params.json` — the exact format expected by the depth-regularised 3DGS training script.

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat prepare_depth_for_3dgs <data_folder>
```

**Output:**
- `distorted/depth/*.png` — 16-bit inverse-depth maps
- `distorted/sparse/0/depth_params.json`

The command also prints the recommended `train.py` invocation at the end.

---

### Visualisation utilities

```bash
# View any PCD file (color modes: rgb, z)
ros2 run liga_splat pcd_viewer <file.pcd> [rgb|z]

# View odometry path + camera frustums overlaid on the point cloud
ros2 run liga_splat pose_viewer <data_folder> [--no-pcd] [--frustum-scale <s>]
```
