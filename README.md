# LiGa Splat - LiDAR-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting Pipeline
A ROS2 pipeline for capturing LiDAR + camera data and converting it into the COLMAP format required to train a [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) model.
This pipeline has the advantage of not relying on visual features for pose extraction and sparse point cloud generation, and can thus work in environments not suitable for the regular COLMAP + 3DGS pipeline. Such environments could be sparse environments like wind turbine scans, or low texture homogenous environments like freighter hulls or tunnels.

With accurate input poses, point clouds, and camera intrinsics, the reconstruction results are very good, both photometrically and geometrically.

As an additional enhancement for sparse scenes with a lot of free space, it is possible to add a background sphere to initialize free space (floating) points on a background. This will further improve sparse environment reconstruction, by providing a clear separation between foreground and background.

This work is a successor to [MESSER for 3DGS](https://github.com/JonanaBanana/MESSER_for_3DGS). It converts the code to C++ and improves upon the pipeline by adding more robust behavior and faster computation with multi-thread processing.

This package has been tested with Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS2 Humble.

## Overview

The pipeline has two phases:

**Phase 1 — Data capture (ROS2 nodes)**
Subscribe to live sensor topics, accumulate and downsample the point cloud in real time, and save images, odometry, and the final point cloud to disk.

**Phase 2 — Offline processing (standalone utilities)**
Process the saved data into the COLMAP format that 3DGS training expects.

## Dependencies

- ROS2 (Humble or later)
- PCL, OpenCV, Eigen3, yaml-cpp
- OpenMP (for parallelised utilities)

```bash
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-pcl-conversions ros-$ROS_DISTRO-cv-bridge \
     libyaml-cpp-dev libopencv-dev libeigen3-dev
```

---

## Build

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select liga_splat
source install/setup.bash
```

---

## Configuration

All user-specific paths and tuning parameters live in one file:

```
config/launch_config.cfg
```

Edit this before running anything. Key fields:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `output_dir` | Root folder where captured data is saved |
| `bag_output_dir` | Folder for rosbag recordings |
| `lidar_topic` | ROS topic for incoming `PointCloud2` messages |
| `image_topic` | ROS topic for incoming `Image` messages |
| `odom_topic` | ROS topic for incoming `Odometry` messages |
| `leaf_size` | Voxel grid leaf size in metres (e.g. `0.03`) |
| `image_save_interval` | Save every Nth image frame |
| `accumulator_max_points` | Publish accumulated cloud after this many points |
| `global_max_points` | Hard cap on the global cloud before aggressive downsampling |

A `config.cfg` file also lives in each **data folder** (copied or created manually) and holds the per-dataset parameters used by the offline utilities (camera intrinsics, transform matrix, depth range, etc.).

---

## Phase 1 — Data Capture

### Option A — Record a rosbag first, play back later

```bash
ros2 launch liga_splat record_bag_launch.py
```

Records LiDAR, camera, odometry, and TF to a timestamped bag in `bag_output_dir`.  
Split size is 1 GB per bag file.

### Option B — Save data directly from live topics

```bash
ros2 launch liga_splat data_saver_launch.py
```

Starts five composable nodes in a single container:

| Node | Role |
|------|------|
| `PointCloudAccumulator` | Buffers incoming LiDAR scans; voxel-filters and forwards when the point count exceeds `accumulator_max_points` (or every `accumulator_publish_interval` frames) |
| `GlobalProcessor` | Maintains a persistent global cloud; periodically downsamples it and saves it as `pcd/input.pcd` |
| `PathPublisher` | Publishes the odometry path for RViz visualisation |
| `ImageSaver` | Saves images and writes `timestamps/image.csv` |
| `OdomSaver` | Saves odometry poses to `timestamps/odom.csv` |

RViz opens automatically with a pre-configured layout.

When capture is complete, kill the launch (Ctrl-C). The global cloud is saved automatically to `<output_dir>/pcd/input.pcd`.

**Output layout after capture:**
```
<output_dir>/
  pcd/input.pcd
  distorted/images/frame_0001.png ...
  timestamps/image.csv
  timestamps/odom.csv
```

---

## Phase 2 — Offline Processing

All utilities are run as:

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat <utility> <data_folder> [options]
```

where `<data_folder>` is the `output_dir` you set in `launch_config.cfg`.

Each utility reads its parameters from `<data_folder>/config.cfg`.

---

### 1. pose_estimator

Matches each saved image to an interpolated odometry pose (linear position + SLERP orientation). A `time_delay` parameter compensates for camera trigger latency.

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat pose_estimator <data_folder>
```

**Output:** `<data_folder>/poses.csv`

---

### 2. registration

Projects the point cloud into each camera image to assign an RGB colour to every visible point. Outputs both a downsampled point cloud (with an optional background sphere added) and a per-point colour observation table.

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat registration <data_folder> [--diag]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--diag` | Save false-colour depth overlay images to `diagnostics/color_registration/` |

**Output:**
- `pcd/downsampled.pcd` — geometry used for all downstream steps
- `color_registration.csv` — per-point colour observations

---

### 3. reconstruction

Fuses the multi-view colour observations into a single coloured point cloud. Each point's final colour is the per-channel median across all views, which suppresses shadows, highlights, and moving objects.

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat reconstruction <data_folder> [--ascii]
```

**Output:** `pcd/reconstructed.pcd`

---

### 4. export_colmap

Exports poses and point cloud in the COLMAP binary/text format required by 3DGS. Runs hidden-point removal per camera to build realistic 2D observation tracks.

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat export_colmap <data_folder>
```

**Output:** `distorted/sparse/0/{cameras,images,points3D}.{bin,txt}`

---

### 5. depth_renderer

Renders a float32 depth map (metres) for each camera pose using the downsampled point cloud. Supports optional hidden-point removal and colour-guided dense completion.

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat depth_renderer <data_folder> [--no-hpr] [--dense] [--diag]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--no-hpr` | Skip hidden-point removal (faster, less accurate) |
| `--dense` | Fill gaps using colour-guided joint bilateral filtering |
| `--diag` | Save false-colour visualisation PNGs to `diagnostics/depth_renders/` |

**Output:** `<depth_dir>/*.tiff`  (default: `depth_renders/`)

---

### 6. prepare_depth_for_3dgs

Converts the float32 TIFF depth maps into 16-bit PNG inverse-depth maps and writes `depth_params.json` — the exact format expected by the depth-regularised 3DGS training script.

```bash
ros2 run liga_splat prepare_depth_for_3dgs <data_folder>
```

**Output:**
- `distorted/depth/*.png` — 16-bit inverse-depth maps
- `distorted/sparse/0/depth_params.json`

The command also prints the recommended `train.py` invocation at the end.

---

### Visualisation utilities

```bash
# View any PCD file (color modes: rgb, z)
ros2 run liga_splat pcd_viewer <file.pcd> [rgb|z]

# View odometry path + camera frustums overlaid on the point cloud
ros2 run liga_splat pose_viewer <data_folder> [--no-pcd] [--frustum-scale <s>]
```
